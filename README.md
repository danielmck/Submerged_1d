# Submerged 1D
A project containing all of the MATLAB code during my PhD. The work primarily considers a debris flow model based on that from Iverson 2014. 
This includes a 1D depthwise model to examine the variations across the depth of the debris flow and the timescales involved with slowing in IversonClosure.
The wave-behaviour in depth averaged models are invesigated in xVariation. Waves in the non-pressure varying model are created and then converted into waves in the model with varying fluid pressure. Parameter stepping can then be used to generate more solutions
